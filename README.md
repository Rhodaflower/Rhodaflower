Hello World, 
I'm Tolu, you can just call me T. Mama to make things easy. I'm a Web3 content writer and creator. 
I currently create contents for web3ladies community. I also manage their social media platforms mostly Twitter. I've written a number of article on NFTs, DeFi, Metaverse and Blockchain generally. 
Wish to learn more about Web3 marketing and how to bridge the gap between the developers and the users.
